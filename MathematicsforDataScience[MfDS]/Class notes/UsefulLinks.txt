A few exercises about basis, linear independence of vectors and span:

Also apparently some of you needed a bit of a reminder about how to solve linear systems so here are 2 useful links: 
1) one link about the 3 main ways to solve a linear system of equations (they talk about 4 methods but the last one is another version of one of the others): https://www.varsitytutors.com/hotmath/hotmath_help/topics/solving-systems-of-linear-equations
2) one link with exercises so you can practice: https://www.zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/Review_Exercises/systemex.html

Lagrangian function

From constrained to unconstrained problem : the Lagrangian function/lagrange multipliers (different names for the same method)
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/constrained-optimization/a/lagrange-multipliers-single-constraint (interesting reading, please try also to change the value of k in the graph with the contour line f(x,y)=k whenever it's possible)

Example of Lagrangian multipliers used to solve a business problem

Note: there is no link about the use of the extreme value theorem because in most problems with an equality constraint, you won't have to prove that part (which you can see in the videos) so I won't ask you to use it. It is more useful in the case of an inequality constraint.
